# Roadmap to Mid-Level - Senior

Here's a self-study roadmap you can follow to tackle SOLID principles, Clean Code and Design Patterns systematically. Each day focuses on incremental learning to prevent overload.

### My Goals
What is my point in here? transition myself from a junior-midlevel for a decent mid-level engineer, to align myself to the best practices while coding.

## Summary/Checkpoint
1. [SOLID](/SOLID/README.md) - In this section, I will be writing stuff/testing about how to implement SOLID foundations to a TypeScript API.

# Roadmap:

## Week 1: SOLID Principles

### Day 1:
- Overview of SOLID principles: what they are and why they matter.
- Focus on the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).
- Refactor a class to align with SRP.

### Day 2:
- Study the Open-Closed Principle (OCP).
- Understand how to extend functionality without modifying existing code.
- Refactor or write an example implementing OCP.

### Day 3:
- Learn the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP).
- Explore how to ensure derived classes work seamlessly with their base classes.
- Write an example.

### Day 4:
- Study the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP).
- Practice creating focused interfaces.

### Day 5:
- Understand the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP).
- Refactor or write code implementing DIP.

### Day 6-7:
- Review all SOLID principles with practical examples.
- Write or refactor a small project applying all principles.

## Week 2: Introduction to Clean Code

### Day 1:
- Read about the importance of clean code.
- Watch a short video or read an article summarizing "Clean Code" by Robert C. Martin.

### Day 2:
- Study naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes.
- Practice refactoring a piece of messy code.

### Day 3:
- Learn about function composition: size, single responsibility, and readability.
- Refactor a function in one of your projects to make it cleaner.

### Day 4:
- Explore the concept of comments: when to use and when to avoid them.
- Identify unnecessary comments in a past project and remove them.

### Day 5:
- Learn about code smells and their solutions.
- Identify code smells in an old project or open-source code.

### Day 6-7:
- Write a small project or program focusing on the principles learned so far.
- Review your code and refactor it for clarity.

## Week 3-4: Design Patterns

### Day 1-2:
- Learn about Creational Patterns: Singleton, Factory, and Builder.
- Implement examples for each.

### Day 3-4:
- Study Structural Patterns: Adapter, Decorator, and Composite.
- Write examples demonstrating their usage.

### Day 5-6:
- Explore Behavioral Patterns: Strategy, Observer, and Command.
- Implement these patterns in a mini-project.

### Day 7:
- Review all patterns studied and summarize their use cases.

## Continuous Practice
- Each week, dedicate one day to review and refactor your projects.
- Share your code on platforms like GitHub or Reddit for feedback.
- As you master these concepts, start integrating them into larger projects.s
